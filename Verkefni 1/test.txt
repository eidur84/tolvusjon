Timing tests are done using for loop in range 10 and timer values averaged.

Processing time for one frame:

With just the frame rate added to each frame the time between frames (loops)
ranges from about 1 ms to 100 ms

average: 48,0 ms

Processing time for one frame with brightness:

The processing time doesn't change dramatically when bright spot detection
is added, with time between frames ranging from 2 ms to little under 100 ms

average: 48,8 ms

Processing time with bright spot and red detection:

Around the same as the others.

average: 48,9 ms

Processing time without image display:

No, the processing time is sbout the same.

Processing time using for loop for bright spot:

It takes about twice the time that of the opencv function

average: 84,7 ms

Latency difference between laptop camera and phone:

Didn't get to that part
